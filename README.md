# Collection of ITK scripts for small stuff<br>
## HistogramSlice<br>
Incomplete. From a 3D volume take out the middle slice (accordance to some direction), and use it to histogram match parallel slices<br>
## IntenseSlice<br>
Complete. Take in two slices of images and compute some regional information based on 2D coordinate inputs
## NormalizeIntense<br>
Working on. Take out slices of images and then normalize them by regional parameters.
